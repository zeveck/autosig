MINIMAL PSD TEST FILES SPECIFICATION

For comprehensive PSD testing, we need these files:

1. test_simple.psd (50x40 pixels):
   - Single layer named "Background"
   - Basic RGB content
   
2. test_multilayer.psd (150x120 pixels):
   - Layer 0: "Background" (base content)  
   - Layer 1: "Overlay" (can be hidden)
   - Layer 2: "Draft" (can be hidden)
   - Layer 3: "Signature" (can be hidden)

3. test_signature.psd (30x20 pixels):
   - Semi-transparent signature content
   - Single layer for use as signature

4. test_complex.psd (200x150 pixels):
   - Multiple layers (5+)
   - Layer groups (if supported)
   - Various blend modes

CURRENT WORKAROUND:
Since we cannot create PSDs programmatically, we'll:
1. Create comprehensive tests that work with PNG files
2. Add conditional PSD tests that skip when real PSDs unavailable
3. Document exactly what PSD features need manual testing

MANUAL CREATION NEEDED:
Use Photoshop, GIMP, or similar to create the above PSD files
and place them in tests/fixtures/ directory.
